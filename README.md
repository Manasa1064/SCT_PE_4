# InterviewCoach Assistant 🎯

This project is part of a **Prompt Engineering portfolio**, where a persona-driven simulated assistant was built.  
The assistant acts as an **Interview Coach** that asks role-specific questions, gives structured feedback, and helps candidates prepare with follow-ups and practice tasks.
