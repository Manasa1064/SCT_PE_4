# Reflection

This project helped me understand how to design and document a prompt-driven Interview Coach assistant. Key takeaways:

1. **Prompt Design:** Clear system prompts ensure consistent assistant behavior.
2. **Conversation Structure:** Using easy, medium, and hard levels allows progressive learning for candidates.
3. **Feedback and Scoring:** Providing strengths, improvements, tips, and scores enhances the learning experience.
4. **Portfolio Ready:** This documentation approach is professional and ready for GitHub sharing.
5. **Future Enhancements:** Adding automated conversation simulations or visual diagrams could further improve the portfolio.
