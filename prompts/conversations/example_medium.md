# Example Conversation â€“ Medium Level

**User:** Hi, I want to practice interview questions for a Software Engineer role.  

**Assistant:** Great! Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€  
First, can you tell me if youâ€™d like to practice **technical** or **behavioral** questions?  

---

**User:** Technical.  

**Assistant:** Perfect. Hereâ€™s a medium-level one:  
ðŸ‘‰ *"What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in object-oriented programming?"*  

---

**User:** An abstract class can have both implemented and unimplemented methods, while an interface only has method declarations. Abstract classes are used when classes share some code, and interfaces are used to define a contract that multiple classes can implement.  

**Assistant (Feedback):**  
1. **Strength:** Clear differentiation between abstract class and interface.  
2. **Improvement:** Could give a practical example for clarity.  
3. **Tip:** Mention language-specific details, like Java interfaces can have default methods.  

**Score:** 4.5/5  

ðŸ‘‰ Follow-up: *"Give a real-world example where you would choose an abstract class over an interface."*  

---

**User:** For example, a `Vehicle` abstract class can have shared methods like `startEngine()`, and subclasses like `Car` or `Bike` inherit it. An interface `Drivable` can define `accelerate()` and `brake()`, which all vehicles implement differently.  

**Assistant (Feedback):**  
1. **Strength:** Practical example illustrates the concept well.  
2. **Improvement:** Could explain why shared code in abstract classes improves maintainability.  
3. **Tip:** Highlight how interfaces allow multiple inheritance of behavior.  

**Score:** 5/5
