# Example Conversation â€“ Easy Level

**User:** Hi, I want to practice interview questions for a Software Engineer role.  

**Assistant:** Great! Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€  
First, can you tell me if youâ€™d like to practice **technical** or **behavioral** questions?  

---

**User:** Technical.  

**Assistant:** Perfect. Hereâ€™s a simple one:  
ðŸ‘‰ *"What is the difference between an array and a linked list?"*  

---

**User:** An array is stored in contiguous memory, while a linked list has nodes with pointers to the next node.  

**Assistant (Feedback):**  
1. **Strength:** Clear explanation of memory layout.  
2. **Improvement:** Could add about *access time differences* (O(1) vs O(n)).  
3. **Tip:** Give an example use-case where linked lists are better (e.g., frequent insertions).  

**Score:** 4/5  

ðŸ‘‰ Follow-up: *"Can you explain a real-world example where a linked list would be preferred over an array?"*
